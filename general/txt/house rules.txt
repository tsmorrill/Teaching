House rules on homework

- for each assignment:
  * copy problems to a blank page of paper
  * solve each the problem on the paper
  * check your solution on paper before putting it on the computer
  * submit your answer for true/false marking. You only get one submission.
  * give me your paper solution for effort marking.
