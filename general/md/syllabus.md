## Grades

### Categories

Assignments are categorized as either circle (●), diamond (◆), or star (★). Different policies apply to these categories (see below).

### Grade Distribution
* 30% ●-Assignments
	- 6% Attendance
	- 10% Classwork
	- 14% Homework
* 40% ◆-Assignments
	- 18% Quizzes
	- 22% Midterm Exam
* 30% ★-Assignments
	- 30% Final Exam

### Final Exam Override
At the end of the term, if you get an A (at least 90%) on the final exam, it will replace your ◆-average.

### Effort Points

Learning to do mathematics well requires you to work hard. To make the work more appealing, some of the points in this course are allotted to making a good effort, not obtaining a correct answer. These effort points will be labelled for your benefit.

Effort points are a way for me to communicate whether you are meeting my expectations as a scholar. They are not a judgement of whether or not you are a good person.

### μ-Rubrics

Most problems in this course will be assessed with a microrubric (μ-rubric for short). The μ-rubric lists a brief partition of the points allotted for the given problem.

#### Computer Scoring (Online Homework)

Some points will be scored by a computer online. You will be given unlimited submissions before the due-date, so try to get the best score you can before time is up.

#### Self-assessment (The Honor System)

Some points will be allotted by self-assessment. You will decide how many points you have earned on a portion of the μ-rubric.

Self-assessment points are a way for me to score tasks which are subjective or difficult for me to verify. I may decrease (or increase!) the number of points awarded if I have significant reason to disagree with your self-assessment.

Students who abuse self-assessment may be assigned zero (0) self-assessment points on future assignments on future assignments as a punishment.

### Homework

#### Practice Homework
* Legible Work: 1 pt (Effort)
* Technique: 2 pts (Effort)
* Correct Answer: 2 pts (Computer Scoring)

#### Project Homework
* Legible Work: 1 pt (Effort)
* Technique: 2 pts (Effort)
* Polished Write-Up: 1 pt (Effort)
* Correct Answer: 1 pt

#### Reading Homework
* Reading: 2 pts (Self-assessment)
* Legible Work: 1 pt (Effort)
* Reflection Diary 2 pts (Effort)

## Slack Policy (Extensions)

Extensions and make-ups are managed by use of the slack system.

### Slack Points

Each student has a number of slack points. Students may exchange their slack for extensions, no questions asked.

Your slack is tracked by a punch-style card which you keep in your possession. Turn in your slack card at my office to spend your slack.

### Slack Redemption

One—and only one—slack point may be spent on a given assignment. Choose one:
* Earn a full score on one (1) ●-assignment,
* Postpone one (1) ◆-assignment by one week (7 days).
* Make-up one (1) ◆-assignment within one week (7 days) of the due date.
* Reschedule one (1) ★-assignment during Finals Week.

Slack spent on ★-assignments must be spent in advance.

Students may propose alternative extensions. I will approve these on a case-by-case basis.

### Acquiring Slack

Each student is given three (3) slack points at the beginning of the term. 

After the midterm, if you have fewer than three (3) slack points, your slack card will be refilled to three (3) slack points.

Your slack card has a number of blank spaces on it, which I will sign as a reward. When the spaces are full, you earn one (1) slack point.

I will sign your card when:
* You use my office hours. These signatures are given on an effort basis.
* You make an exceptional effort on a ●-assignment. I decide what counts as exceptional.

Some classwork assignments will be team competitions. I will sign the cards of the winning team. Competition place does not affect your grade otherwise.

### The Honor System

Students who abuse slack may lose their slack points as a punishment.
